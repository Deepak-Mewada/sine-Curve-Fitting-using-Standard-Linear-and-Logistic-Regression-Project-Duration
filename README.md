# sine-Curve-Fitting-using-Standard-Linear-and-Logistic-Regression-Project-Duration

Mini Project | Machine learning Course | Semester#2

A#Objective:
Rajesh boasted to his friends that he has been doing an online machine learning course and has now
mastered regression techniques. He has not even started the course but wanted to show off in front of his
friends. However he forgot the fact that the father of one of his friends was a data scientist at an eminent
company. So his friend wanted to test him and thereby got his father to list out some questions which he could
give Rajesh to solve. Rajesh is in a dilemma and now needs your help so that his truth does not come out.
Your task is to complete the tasks as mentioned below. It will involve writing code to perform basic curve
fitting using standard regression techniques.
